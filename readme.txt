Include a script to destroy the cluster and also provide steps to deploy scheduler it to run at a predefined time of day.

## I am assuming that we will need a script to deploy the resources every day in 9pm and a script to destroy the resources every day in 6pm for developer to work during the working hour,
So we will have 2 scripts scheduled to run every weekday.
